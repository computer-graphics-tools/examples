# Photons Project

## Overview

Photons is an example project showcasing the use of particle simulation, scene reconstruction, collision handling, and tracking techniques for hands and head. This project demonstrates how to integrate RealityKit, Metal, and ARKit to create an interactive expirience with particle physics, powered by simulation-tools and metal-tools packages.

## Features

- **Particle Simulation:** Implements particle simulation using Metal compute shaders.
- **Scene Reconstruction:** Utilizes ARKit for real-time scene reconstruction, allowing the app to understand and interact with the physical environment.
- **Collision Handling:** Uses spatial hashing and collision detection to manage interactions between particles and the environment.
- **Hand and Head Tracking:** Employs ARKit to track the user's hands and head.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 16 or later
- visionOS 2.0 or later

### Usage

1. Launch the app on your device.
2. Use the "Reset" button to reset the particle simulation.
3. Tap the import icon to select an image from your photo library.
4. Toggle between immersive and standard modes using the immersive space button.
5. Interact with the particles using your hands and observe real-time scene reconstruction and collision handling.
